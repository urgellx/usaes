# Urgelle's Short and Easy Stuff

## A few very very small scripts  
### FZF  
Two fzf bookmarking scripts, one to save what's in the clipboard    
and another one to open (Firefox & Amfora) or copy them.  

###ROFI  
Two to download, open, and save videos where you want (interactive)  
(Uses mpv and yt-dlp, folder are easily changed)  
One to shut down and reboot.  
One to mount and unmount Luks encrypted usb keys.

## Have a good day, internet person.
