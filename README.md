# Urgelle's Short and Easy Stuff

## What's included in this repository:

### A firefox userChrome.css
Hides almost all of the top navigator-toolbox
(the stuff at the top of your window), only 
leaving the tab that you're on visible. Of 
course, you can still see everything when you
hover over it.

### A few very very small scripts
One to shut down and reboot
One to mount and unmount Luks encrypted usb keys

## Have a good day, internet person.
